During his visit to Kenya, State Councilor Wang Yong, as the Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping, will attend the launch ceremony for the freight service of the Nairobi-Malaba Standard Gauge Railway project (phase one). </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Q: At a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart Lavrov, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that today's threat to strategic stability go far beyond missiles and submarines. China has to be brought in to a wider arms control discussion. Though China is estimated to have far fewer nuclear weapons than the United States and Russia, the arms control talks are not intended to restrict the nuclear power of any country, but to have constructive dialogue and uphold global security and stability. What's your comment?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: China has repeatedly reiterated that it has no intention of participating in the so-called trilateral arms control negotiations&nbsp;with the US and Russia. This position is very clear and has been widely understood by the international community including Russia. The US constantly makes an issue of China on nuclear disarmament issue to shirk and shift the responsibility for nuclear disarmament. China is firmly opposed to that. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">China believes that as a country that possesses the world's largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal, the United States should take the special responsibility for nuclear disarmament, respond to Russia's call to extend the&nbsp;New START&nbsp;Treaty, and further downsize its huge nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other nuclear weapon states to join multilateral disarmament talks. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">If the US really cares about the global strategic stability, it should stop withdrawing from international treaties and agreements, stop negative moves that undermine global strategic balance and stability, and stop playing up power competition and confrontation. It should immediately return to the right track of multilateralism, safeguard international order based on international law and uphold the authority and effectiveness of the legal system of international arms control and non-proliferation regime. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">I want to stress that China is consistently committed to upholding the international arms control and non-proliferation regime, advancing international arms control and disarmament process and safeguarding global strategic balance and stability. China stands ready to work with all parties to strengthen communication and coordination within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament and the mechanism of five nuclear-weapon states, discuss a wide range of issues concerning global strategic stability and make positive contributions to international peace and security. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Q: US Secretary of State Pompeo said in a statement yesterday that China continues to repress members of religious and ethnic minority groups. In order to regain moral authority in the eyes of freedom-loving nations, China must rededicate itself to protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. What's your comment?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: What the US says reminds me of the foolish emperor in Andersen's fairy tale "the Emperor's New Clothes". It cannot be more ironic that a naked man is so proud of his imaginary clothes.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">The US today is in no position to talk about human rights or morality with China. Yesterday I detailed the great achievements in China's human rights progress over the past seven decades since the founding of the PRC. Its vast land of 9.6 million square kilometers is free from war, terror and displacement. People of all 56 ethnic groups live in harmony. 850 million people have&nbsp;got out of poverty and 1.4 billion people lead happy and fulfilling lives. For over ten consecutive years, China has contributed to over 30% of global GDP growth. It has created a development miracle in human history and made huge contribution to world human rights cause, winning worldwide acclaim.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">In stark contrast, the US faces rampant and serious racial discrimination at home. Besides, it has a hand in other countries' internal affairs wherever it can, instigates "color revolutions" and regime change, stages wars and kills innocent lives in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. How many bad things has it done under the pretext of freedom and human rights all round the world? Apart from that, It abuses state power and the concept of national security to oppress certain enterprises, wantonly wields the big stick of sanction, willfully practices unilateralism, pulls out of international treaties and organizations and undermines international multilateral mechanisms without a shred of credibility left.</SPAN> <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">However, the US is so proud rather than ashamed when such behaviors raise eyebrows across the world. It is no longer a city upon the hill but still acts so arrogantly without even knowing that. In the meantime, we noticed more and more rational reflection and voice at home in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Knowing oneself is a wisdom and merit. We hope the US will get to know this point. </SPAN></P>

The report said that the US government pathetically knows nothing about who is the enemy. This most prolonged war in US history which costs $1 trillion and&nbsp;2,400 lives of US service men and women in fact led to thousands needlessly killed. According to UN statistics, 3,804 Afghan civilians were killed in 2018. In the first 10 months this year, US-backed airstrikes have killed 579 civilians. What's your comment?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: For the US, a self-claimed "defender of human rights and morality", this report is such a loud slap in the face. And I'm afraid this is only the tip of the iceberg&nbsp;for what the US has done. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">As you may recall, under the pretext of Iraq hiding weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), the US launched attacks in Iraq that caused hundreds of thousands of innocent casualties and over a million displaced people. It was years later that the US admitted errors in its intelligence and that the so-called evidence for WMDs was merely a small bag of washing powder. Claiming that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its people, the US launched air strikes in Syria, leaving tens of thousands injured, killed and displaced. However, later it was found out that the "evidence" that the US presented to prove the Syrian government used chemical weapons to kill its citizens was nothing more than a video that was self-choreographed, self-directed and self-acted by the White Helmets. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Sadly, the US apparently didn't learn the lessons at all. It is still striking everywhere under trumped-up pretexts. Tragedies are still ongoing. This country has become the most dangerous threat against world peace, security and stability. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Our world is at a critical crossroads, and we cannot afford losing international justice. We hope the US will sincerely reflect on its deeds and restore rules, order, peace and tranquility for the world. </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: I'm not aware of the number you asked about. But I can tell you responsibly that as a responsible member of the international community, China earnestly implements UN resolutions. </SPAN></P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Q: In 2017, State Councilor Wang Yong attended the launch ceremony for the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway as the Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping. This time and in the same capacity, he will witness the inauguration of the Nairobi-Malaba Standard Gauge Railway project (phase one). Why does China believe that it is important to do this? How does China view its railway cooperation with Kenya? What is China's expectation for bilateral cooperation in this area?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: Since its completion, the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway has seen a safe and smooth operation and played a positive role in driving Kenya's economic and social development, speeding up its industrialization and promoting regional connectivity. Phase one of the Nairobi-Malaba Railway is an extension of the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway as it stretches into the inland areas of Kenya. It is another important outcome of China-Kenya and China-Africa cooperation on industrial capacity and the Belt and Road Initiative. During the construction of the Nairobi-Malaba Railway, as with the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, China and Kenya have been cooperating under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits for common development and win-win-results and living up to the green and environment-conscious development concept, which stands as a shining example for China-Africa infrastructure building cooperation.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">The completion of Phase one of the Nairobi-Malaba Railway will further reduce the logistics and transportation costs for Kenya and East Africa. China and Kenya will work together to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway and the Nairobi-Malaba Railway and fully tap into the economic and social potential brought along by the railway projects.</SPAN> </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: There is a factual error in your question. China and the Faroe Islands are not in talks for a free trade agreement. How could it be canceled? Why would the Chinese ambassador threaten to cancel it? If you see how senior U.S. officials smear and attack Chinese companies wherever they go and threaten others to stop doing business with these companies, you will get an idea of what the real threat is.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">China and the Faroe Islands of Denmark enjoy good cooperative relations.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Over the past 25 years since the establishment of the WTO, the dispute settlement system has played an outstanding role. Panels and Appellate Body have rendered decisions in almost 200 disputes and most have been settled smoothly and effectively. But the US persists to go its own way and obstruct the process, finally paralyzing the whole Appellate Body. This reveals the fragility of the multilateral trading system. What is the Appellate Body worth? For those who uphold multilateralism, it is invaluable. For those who prefer laws of the jungle, perhaps it is worthless.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">But the international community cannot afford to lose justice. Nobody and no country should be allowed to do whatever they want. This is the shared view of the vast majority of the international community. We note that 117 Members have called&nbsp;for the immediate launch of selection process which is a strong testimony of the majority membership's political will to restore the Appellate Body. China will continue to work with like-minded members to address the challenge facing the Appellate Body.</SPAN> </P>

A report has been published today by the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists. The report says that at least 48 journalists are currently jailed, detained in China. It says it's the largest number of any country in the world. Does China confirm this number of 48 journalists jailed?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: First, you said it's a US-based organization, right? After all that has happened, there is no credibility left to US-manipulated organizations. Do you agree?</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Second, you said 48 journalists were detained. I wonder if you were talking about Chinese or foreign journalists? Nearly 600 foreign journalists are leading a happy life here in China. In fact, I think it's fortunate that you work in Beijing instead of Washington D.C. I noted some media saying that journalists there were fired just because they didn't report or misreported certain things. Fortunately you are working in China. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">During the recent disturbances in Hong Kong, media reports showed that some fake journalists did illegal things. But I don't recall seeing&nbsp;relevant organizations&nbsp;condemning their behaviors that tainted the reputation of the press community. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">I'm not aware of the details of the US-based committee you talked about, and I cannot verify the number for you. But since China is a country based on rule of law, no one is above the law. No matter you are a journalist or a public servant, if you violate the law, you will be punished. Before asking this question, I think you need to first know if those people breached the law. </P>

There are also reports saying that WADA has always been cutting American athletes some slack. In 2015, 402 American athletes were granted Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) among 653 who applied for it, while only 20 Russian athletes were granted TUE in the same year. This revelation brings us to what's happened to Chinese athletes recently. What is your comment?</SPAN></B> </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">A: Whether they talked about Huawei or not, does it make a difference?&nbsp;While American officials and ambassadors&nbsp;are free to&nbsp;slander Huawei wherever they go, why is it that a Chinese&nbsp;ambassador cannot even mention&nbsp;the name of a Chinese&nbsp;company during discussions on cooperation with&nbsp;host country&nbsp;officials?
