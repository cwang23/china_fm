Could you update us on the latest development?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Zhao Lijian: The China-Africa relations have drawn widespread attention recently. As you said, China and Africa have maintained close communication and friendly consultation on the situation of African nationals in Guangdong province over the past few days. State Councilor Wang Yi had a telephone conversation with Chairman Faki of the African Union Commission, and Assistant Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong met with African diplomatic envoys to China. The Chinese embassies in Africa have also been in active communication with the African side. The Chinese side reiterated that there has been no change in its friendly policy towards Africa. Facing grave risks of importing cases in Guangdong, China has strengthened its prevention and control measures and adhered to the principle of treating Chinese nationals and foreigners as equals, and will not adopt differentiated policies towards any special groups. Taking into consideration the concerns of the African side, Guangdong has further improved its health management measures for foreigners. It is learned that on the premise of complying with China's provisions on epidemic prevention, many African nationals are returning home&nbsp;for self-quarantine, and proper arrangements have been made for African nationals in difficulties. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">African governments and African diplomatic envoys in China generally believe that under the current situation when all countries are strengthening epidemic prevention and control measures, Guangdong's measures are responsible&nbsp;for all Chinese and foreigners&nbsp;and&nbsp;completely understandable. Foreigners who work and live locally should show their cooperation and support. The African side appreciates that China takes Africa's concerns seriously and notes the continuous improvement of the situation involving Africans in relevant cities in Guangdong. The African side will cooperate with China to educate and guide its citizens to abide by China's provisions on epidemic prevention and control. Many African friends also pointed out that after verification, many of the videos circulating online have been found to be edited and did not tell the whole story. Both China and Africa should be vigilant against online contents that may mislead people's perceptions and sentiments. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out in a telephone conversation with AUC Chairman Faki that the traditional friendship between China and Africa is as solid as a rock and unbreakable. It will not be affected as time passes and events arise, nor will it be disrupted by any alienating attempts. Chairman Faki said that the African side does not believe that China will adopt a policy of racial discrimination against the African people. Africa and China are friends and now comrades-in-arms in the fight against the COVID-19. Nothing can change or damage Africa-China friendship. In the next stage, China and Africa will continue to stand firmly together to secure the final victory against the pandemic. </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Zhao Lijian: My colleagues and I already responded to similar questions, and I'd like to reiterate our position. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Many countries have recently been purchasing medical products in China. While satisfying domestic demands, we support export by companies with qualifications and credibility, and provide convenience in production, transport and customs clearance to facilitate foreign procurement and orderly exporting. Some countries raised purchasing demands via diplomatic channels, and we recommend qualified companies to the foreign buyers. As far as I know, we haven't received any complaints from the buyers about the products purchased via the above-mentioned channel. &nbsp; </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Several countries raised doubts on the quality of products imported from China, to which our embassies responded at the earliest time possible. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">I would like to stress that the quality and safety of medical supplies directly bears on the lives and health of people. China attaches great importance to the export of medical products and cracks down on counterfeit and shoddy products. Once there are quality problems, the regulatory authorities will conduct serious investigation and mete out punishment with zero tolerance in accordance with the law. At the same time, we also hope that foreign buyers can choose products that have been certified by Chinese regulatory authorities with production qualifications, and carefully follow&nbsp;the instructions for use and check whether&nbsp;the products are compatible with domestic market standards&nbsp;so as to&nbsp;avoid making mistakes in a rush. If there are any problems in the market, the two sides should come down to where the problems lie&nbsp;and solve them in accordance with the law and in market-based manner. </P>
