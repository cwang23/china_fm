<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Today marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the European Union. As the two major forces, markets and civilizations in the world, China and the EU have played irreplaceable roles in upholding world multipolarization, multilateralism and free trade. Since we established diplomatic ties 45 years ago, our bilateral relations have made substantial progress. China and the EU have been deepening partnership with the principle of mutual respect and harmonious co-existence, as evidenced by stronger mutual political trust, fruitful practical cooperation and rich cultural and people-to-people exchange, which has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples and contributed to world peace and prosperity. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and the EU have lent firm support to each other and jointly advanced&nbsp;global anti-epidemic cooperation. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">The healthy and steady development of China-EU relationship serves the fundamental interests of the two sides and accords with the trend of the times. Under the new circumstances, China and the EU should join hands, expand consensus, continue to firmly uphold multilateralism,&nbsp;build on practical cooperation and strengthen communication and cooperation on international issues. We hope that the two sides will take the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties as a new historical starting point to advance the China-EU partnerships for peace, growth, reform and civilization, and shape a more wonderful and brilliant future for China-EU relations. </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">In his Xinhua interview, Mr. Galea made his points very clear.

Mr. Galea also said that this February, the WHO and China jointly determined research fields where further study is needed on the virus, including the animal source of the virus.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Mr. Pottinger was wrong in calling the May Fourth Movement a populist movement. The movement is a great patriotic revolution against imperialism and feudalism at a crucial moment for the Chinese nation. Patriotism is at its very core. And patriotism runs in the veins of the Chinese nation. The true heirs of the movement today is Chinese citizens with a patriotic heart. In this new era, carrying forth the May Fourth spirit means working for the building of a strong modern socialist country and realizing the great renewal of the Chinese nation.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Perhaps Mr. Pottinger forgot what triggered the May Fourth Movement. It was because foreign powers were trading their privileges in Chinese territory at the Peace Conference in Paris after World War I, and the Chinese people would never accept such loss of rights and national humiliation. Today, 101 years from then, if there are still people in Washington who want to act like bullies and pin the blame on China to get away with their poor handling of COVID-19, the 1.4 billion Chinese people will never allow it.

Experts say this means the confirmed coronavirus was in France almost two months earlier than previously known. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said on May 5 that the French case that appeared in December is not thought to have a direct link to China and this would give a "new and clearer picture" of the outbreak.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Hua Chunying: Indeed, I also noted these reports&nbsp;recently. I think this again shows that tracing the origin of virus is very complicated </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Where did the first&nbsp;cases occur? When did it occur? So far neither scientists nor disease control experts have reached a definite conclusion. The relevant work is ongoing and it must be studied by scientists and professionals, and the origin and transmission path of virus must be judged based on science and facts, so that human beings can better deal with such major infectious diseases in the future.</P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Hua Chunying: Mr. Pompeo says there is "enormous evidence". Then show it.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">The origin of virus is a complex and controversial issue, but there is a broad consensus in the international community that it is a very serious&nbsp;scientific issue that must be studied by scientists and medical experts on the basis of facts and science. At present, almost all the top scientists in the world, including famous scientists in the United States and experts in the field of disease control and prevention, believe that novel coronavirus originated from nature, not man-made, and there is no evidence of any so-called virus leakage from the laboratory. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">I've seen a number of new reports of initial infections in recent days. For example, the US may have seen the first cases in last October, and France in December. WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said there could be earlier cases, and urged countries to investigate pneumonia cases of unknown origin in late 2019. At a regular press conference on May 5, Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the WHO's emergency program said some 15,000 full genome sequences of the novel coronavirus available show the novel coronavirus is not man-made. A few days ago, Yuan Zhiming, Director of the National Biosafety Laboratory in Wuhan, also gave a detailed&nbsp;statement to questions concerning the origin of virus in an interview with Reuters. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Mr. Pompeo has repeatedly said that he has "evidence", but he simply cannot&nbsp;present it. How could he bring it out? Because he didn't have it! </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">The website of Politico previously exposed a 57-page memo the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent to electoral organizations, which encouraged "actively attacking China" as a response to the coronavirus crisis, as well as three approaches to attack China including attributing the spread of virus to China's cover-up. The core is to attack China whenever they mention it. There have been so many spoilers in&nbsp;the screenplay of this US blame game&nbsp;and there is no point in continuing. A word of advice to those certain individuals in the US: Don't be too immersed in and addicted to this play. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">I have also seen reports that Mr. Pompeo told the media that China has infected the world with viruses before, and that its laboratory operations are not standard and this is not the first time the world has faced a virus threat because of the failure of Chinese laboratory. Will Mr. Pompeo care to explain which Chinese lab has failed at what and when and where that failure happened? </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">What the international community knows clearly is that: the US used germ weapons during the Korean War and Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. For nearly two decades, the US, on its own, has been blocking the resumption of negotiation on a verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. On August 2019, the US CDC abruptly order the closure of the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick. The US has set up many laboratories in the territory of the former Soviet Union but clammed up about what it's doing in these labs and how safe they are. </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">The fact is that the Chinese government, in an open, transparent and responsible manner, informed the world of the epidemic at the earliest time possible, shared experience in prevention and control, and conducted international cooperation, which has been lauded by the international community. Due to the epidemics, some face-to-face diplomatic activities have to be suspended but we have conducted substantial, frequent telephone diplomacy. Chinese leadership has had nearly 50 telephone calls with their foreign counterparts and State Councilor Wang Yi held around 80 talks by phone. China has received appreciation for such open sharing of experience and its contribution to the concerted global response. We see this in President Xi</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">'</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">s attendance at the G20 Extraordinary Virtual Leaders' Summit on COVID-19 and Premier Li Keqiang</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">'</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">s attendance at the Special ASEAN Plus Three Summit on COVID-19.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Like I said, despite the daunting task of prevention at home, China has been providing other countries with anti-virus supplies to the best of its ability. We have held over&nbsp;120 video conferences of health experts with more than 150 countries, and sent&nbsp;21 medical teams to 19 countries. There have been many touching stories in this process.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Meanwhile certain people in the US, out of political calculations, went from bad to worse, stigmatizing and smearing China with all they</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">'</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">ve got in an attempt to shift the blame. This has caused misunderstanding or even aversion towards China in some ill-informed&nbsp;people in the US and some other countries, poisoning the public</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">'</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">s perception of China. According to US media reports, due to inappropriate linkage of Asian groups with COVID-19, Asians in the US have fallen victim to serious xenophobia and frequent harassment and assault driven by racial discrimination. This will neither help with international cooperation in fighting the pandemic nor improve the American image or reputation.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">We have made clear our solemn position to the US side through various channels and urged it to immediately stop smearing China. As for your reference to whether it will lead to military conflict, this is certainly the last thing we want to see. China always loves peace. We believe that all parties should be committed to deepening mutual understanding and trust through anti-epidemic cooperation and jointly building a community with a shared future for mankind, rather than creating or even provoking conflicts using the epidemic as an excuse. This may be what individual politicians in the US have been up to, but this attempt will be firmly opposed not only by the Chinese people, but also by all peace-loving and fair-minded people in the world. As I said just now, China is no longer what it was 101 years ago. We want some people in Washington to think hard about how strongly the 1.4 billion Chinese people would respond if they wanted to use the outbreak today to blame and bully China.</SPAN> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Phoenix TV: According to US media reports, the US is pressuring the European allies to side with it on assigning the responsibility of the outbreak. Some critics in Europe argue that the confrontation between China and the US will continue to intensify after the outbreak, that the process of globalization will inevitably be shaken, and European countries must make a choice. What is China's comment?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Hua Chunying: Your question at least illustrates the fact that the US is exerting pressure on its Allies and on other countries as well. To say that it has asked them to stand with the US on the accountability issue is a polite and civilized way to put it, when the US is actually asking them to be accomplice in framing China. As we all know, the US, out of domestic political needs, has repeatedly ignored the facts so that it can dump the blame on others. It is true that a choice has to be made by Europe and others, not between China and the US, but between lies and facts, between unilateral bullying and multilateral cooperation. It is easy to make such a choice and in fact many countries have done so with action. A recent example is the clear support of EU leaders for WHO to continue to play an important role in responding to outbreaks and strengthening the global public health system. To support and echo the WHO initiative, the EU held a pledging conference on 4 May which raised 7.4 billion euros &nbsp;for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment and vaccine production. China has taken an active part in it and made our contribution. On strengthening solidarity and cooperation to combat the epidemic, China has always stood firmly with the UN, the WHO and other countries and made every possible contribution, while the US stands on the opposite side of the vast majority of the international community.&nbsp;</P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Hua Chunying: On the issue of a review, as I just said, since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has been working closely with WHO in an open, transparent and responsible manner and supporting the global response with concrete actions. We stand ready to continue joint efforts with the international community to ramp up cooperation in fighting the pandemic. &nbsp;We support summarizing and reviewing the epidemic response at an appropriate time to advance international health cooperation and improve the global public health security governance so that we can deal with similar challenges better in the future. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">What we oppose is the so-called investigation chanted by politicians in a few countries out of domestic political calculations based on the presumption of guilt. What we oppose is political maneuvers of the pandemic, which run counter to the original mission of scientific research and disrupt the concerted international response. China's position is clear-cut. We are completely above-board and have nothing to hide. We hope the international community will render active support to WHO's work. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">On the Taiwan region's participation in WHO activities, China's position is clear and consistent. It must be handled according to the one-China principle. Under this precondition, China's Central Government has made proper arrangement for the Taiwan region's participation in global health affairs, which ensures that the region can deal with local or global public health emergencies in a timely and effective manner. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the DPP authorities have been engaging in political manipulation and constant hype-up over the issue of Taiwan's participation in WHO and WHA. The real intention is very clear.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;taking advantage of the virus to seek independence. We firmly reject this futile attempt. </P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>China always maintains that the Venezuelan issue should and must be resolved through consultation and dialogue between the Venezuelan government and opposition.

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>Hua Chunying: Speaking of tariffs, I think facts have proven that it's an unwieldy weapon which is likely to hurt oneself as it wounds others. A trade war doesn't serve anyone's interests. In particular, under current circumstances, all parties need to work together instead of coercing others with the big stick of tariffs. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>On the claim that China spread the virus, we need to get the facts straight. China has repeatedly shared the timeline of its response. On December 27, 2019, Dr. Zhang Jixian reported the first three suspected cases. On December 30, Wuhan Municipal Health Committee issued an "urgent notice on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause". On December 31, China informed WHO China of pneumonia cases of unknown cause. On January 3, 2020, China started to send timely updates to WHO and other countries, including the US. On January 23, China temporarily closed exit channels in Wuhan, sending a strong warning signal to the world. Back then there was only a total of 9 confirmed cases outside China, of which just one was in the US. On January 31, three major American airlines suspended direct flights between the US and China. On February 2, the US closed borders to all Chinese citizens and foreign nationals with travel history to China in the past 14 days. By then there was only about 10 confirmed cases reported in the US. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>We noticed that on May 1, the US CDC released on its website a report by its Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat and the CDC COVID-19 Response Team. The report clearly states that continued travel-associated importations, not from China, large gatherings and cryptic transmission resulting from limited testing and asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread contributed to accelerated spread during February–March 2020. These are plain facts. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>The facts have proven that it is absurd to accuse China of spreading the virus. We may compare China's response with that in the US. China notified the US of the epidemic situation on January 3, while the US announced a national state of emergency on March 13, which means it took the US government 70 days. Even if we start counting from February 2 when the US closed borders to all Chinese citizens and foreign nationals with travel history to China in the past 14 days, it still took them as long as 40 days to respond. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>China contained the spread of the virus in just over two months. On April 8, when the lockdown on Wuhan was lifted, the number of confirmed cases in the US had surged to nearly 400,000. Today it's more than 1.2 million. I wonder what the US was doing in the past months? Why would it allow things to end up like this? Is that what a responsible government does for its people? </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>We advise the US to stop trying to deflect attention and shift the blame onto China. It should put its own house in order first, contain the epidemic at home and do its utmost to save lives and keep its people healthy. Lives matter more than political gains. We hope the US government will manage its own affairs properly and give the America people a clear explanation. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Beijing Daily: On April 30, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in the US&nbsp;issued a press release saying that the Intelligence Community concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified. On May 4 CNN reported that according to two Western officials, intelligence shared among Five Eyes nations indicates it is "highly unlikely" that the coronavirus outbreak was spread as a result of an accident in a laboratory On the same day, National Geographic published an interview with Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, who said the scientific evidence is very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated. Do you have any comment?</SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>Hua Chunying: I also noted relevant reports. Indeed, there has been a lot of reports and speculations about the origin of virus in the United States recently. As I said just now, some individuals in the US have been constantly accusing China&nbsp;out of&nbsp;their own domestic political interests and considerations, but their statements are often inconsistent and unfounded, thus cannot stand up to scrutiny. What they said have too often been denounced by scientists or medical and disease control specialists. Those in the US who are scapegoating China to shift blame should do soul-searching and learn their lessons. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>As we repeatedly stressed, the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue that should be answered by scientists and experts through rigorous and meticulous scientific research, one that should not be decided by politicians. We firmly oppose politicizing and stigmatizing the issue of the origin of the virus, and once again call on all people&nbsp;to respect science and stay away from conspiracy theories. </P>

I wonder if this requirement is only for passengers from Russia or for other countries too?&nbsp;Will this requirement be extended to other airlines? If we look at the future, sooner or later, borders will open and people will start traveling again. Do you think this is going to be a general requirement in the future for getting Chinese visa or entering the country?</B></SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>Hua Chunying: As you may know, given the current situation, China and many other countries are in close communication on how to strengthen border quarantine control, including how to ensure the safety of international travel and prevent the importation of cases. The only goal is to find ways to minimize the spread of the epidemic. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>China and Russia have maintained high-level cooperation in epidemic prevention and control. According to the situation of the spread of infection in the civil aviation flights between China and Russia, China plans to temporarily implement the boarding policy which requires negative nucleic acid test results for all passengers of Air China's Moscow-Beijing flights. The move is aimed at preventing airline passengers from being cross-infected and causing a wider spread of the disease. You may check with the competent authorities of the Chinese side for details. </P>

Can you confirm this? </SPAN></B></P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>Hua Chunying: I'm not sure about the specific situation you mentioned. In fact, a lot of scientific cooperation projects have been carried out among scientists from various countries, including those conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology with relevant scientific research institutions from many countries in the world in the spirit of openness, transparency and science. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial">Bloomberg: We<B>'</B><B>ve seen that US House Republican lawmakers have asked the education department for information about China investing in American colleges and universities as a way to further its strategic and propaganda goals. In a letter to Education Secretary, lawmakers said that China has strategically invested in US academia to steal information and technology. I wonder if you have any response to this?</B></SPAN></B> </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>Hua Chunying: I think in recent days, some politicians and congressmen in the US have done something to refresh or subvert people's understanding of disinformation. Because for them, as long as China is concerned, it's all about either spreading disinformation or pursuing political propaganda, despite what presented is plain truth. And American politicians, no matter how much they lie, they can do that without any sense of guilt or shame. So I wonder if this is a double standard, or if they believe deep in their hearts that the moral standards between China and the United States are different? Who is spreading disinformation? Who's making political propaganda? Recently, a lot has been disclosed by a series of reports in the US, and I think everyone sees it clearly so there's no need to name them one by one. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: 14px; FONT-FAMILY: arial" align=justify>As two major countries, China and the US should create favorable conditions and provide an appropriate atmosphere for normal exchanges and cooperation between the educational and scientific communities of the two countries, instead of politicizing and demonizing all normal academic and scientific exchanges and cooperation. I think this is not conducive to the mutual understanding between the two peoples and the normal development of bilateral relations in the long run. </P>
